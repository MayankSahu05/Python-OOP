    "## Part A — Python OOP Theory Answers\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming is a paradigm where data and behavior are bundled together in units called objects.\n",
    "It promotes **reusability**, **modularity**, and **abstraction**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, brand, model):\n",
    "        self.brand = brand\n",
    "        self.model = model\n",
    "\n",
    "    def drive(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"{self.brand} {self.model} is driving!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "car1 = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\")\n",
    "car1.drive()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
    "A **class** is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes (data) and methods (behavior).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
    "An **object** is an instance of a class, containing real values for the attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Difference between abstraction and encapsulation\n",
    "- **Abstraction** → Hides implementation details; shows only necessary features.\n",
    "- **Encapsulation** → Bundles data and methods, restricting access using private/protected modifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
    "\"Dunder\" means **double underscore**. These special methods (`__init__`, `__str__`, etc.) define behavior for built-in operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Example:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __str__(self):\n",
    "        return f\"Example object: {self.name}\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Inheritance in OOP\n",
    "Allows a class to derive properties/methods from another class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Polymorphism\n",
    "Ability to use the same interface for different data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Encapsulation in Python\n",
    "Achieved via private attributes (`_` or `__`) and getter/setter methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Constructor in Python\n",
    "`__init__` method runs automatically when an object is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. Class & Static Methods\n",
    "- **@classmethod** → Works with class state, first argument is `cls`.\n",
    "- **@staticmethod** → Does not access class or instance state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11. Method Overloading\n",
    "Not natively supported; can use default args.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12. Method Overriding\n",
    "Child class changes a method of the parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 13. Property Decorator\n",
    "`@property` lets a method be accessed like an attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 14. Importance of Polymorphism\n",
    "Makes code flexible and reusable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 15. Abstract Class\n",
    "A class that cannot be instantiated; may have abstract methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 16. Advantages of OOP\n",
    "- Reusability\n",
    "- Modularity\n",
    "- Scalability\n",
    "- Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 17. Class vs Instance Variables\n",
    "- Class variable → Shared by all instances.\n",
    "- Instance variable → Unique per object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 18. Multiple Inheritance\n",
    "Inheriting from more than one base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 19. __str__ vs __repr__\n",
    "- `__str__` → User-friendly representation.\n",
    "- `__repr__` → Developer/debug representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 20. super()\n",
    "Calls a method from the parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 21. __del__\n",
    "Destructor, runs when object is deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 22. @staticmethod vs @classmethod\n",
    "- Static method → No `self` or `cls`.\n",
    "- Class method → Has `cls`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 23. Polymorphism with Inheritance\n",
    "Through method overriding.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 24. Method Chaining\n",
    "Returning `self` to allow multiple method calls in a single statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 25. __call__\n",
    "Allows object to be called like a function.\n"
